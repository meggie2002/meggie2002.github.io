## 🎯 What I Do

I don't just build models I figure out what problems need solving, choose the right technical approach, and deliver solutions that work in the real world.

**My approach:**
- Problem assessment before solution design
- Scientific validation at every stage
- Clear communication across technical and non-technical audiences
- Balancing precision with practicality
